# Wish list
*This is our current wish list / list of ideas*

### 3D printers
We would like to be able to host 3D printer events and teach the students and teachers about the technologies possibilities. 

- 2 x Creality Ender 3V2 printers.
- 2 x Voron V0 Core XY printers. These are really awesome and fast + they are opensource! :O
- Perhaps a resin printer too. 
- Multiple colours of filament.

### Lasercutter stuff

- A new storage solution for materials.

### Electronics and components

- Component storage.
- Soldering stations and ventilation systems. 

### Computers

- All kinds of computers, we are open for donations. Please contact us [here](https://ngmakerspace.github.io/about.html). :)
